    Traverse the directed tree graph starting from the specified root node,

    Args:
        graph (nx.DiGraph): A valid directed acyclic graph representing an arborescence.
        root (Any): The root node of the tree (node with in-degree == 0).
        root_obstruction (float): The initial obstruction value for the root node.
            Defaults to 0.0.
