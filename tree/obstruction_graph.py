    Traverses the arborescence `graph` from `root`, computes a cumulative obstruction value

    obstruction attribute, and stores the result in a new edge attribute.

    Args:
        graph (nx.DiGraph): Directed acyclic graph representing an arborescence.
        root (Any, optional): The root node (in-degree == 0). If None, it is auto-detected.
